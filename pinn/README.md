# The PINN Code

This directory contains the code for training PINNs in our paper, and is forked from the official repo of "[Challenges in Training PINNs: A Loss Landscape Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01868)".

Our algorithm is implemented in `src/opts/adap_newton_cg.py`, and you can run the scripts in `config` to reproduce the results.
